This directory contains the serial PyTorch code for training a simple classifier on MNIST (`mnist_classify.py`). The exercise is to modify this code and add DDP functionality to it, either assuming it will be run with the `srun` parallel launcher, or (as a bonus exercise) the `torchrun` parallel launcher. The answers are already present in this directory, but the exercise is to start from `mnist_classify.py` and try to modify the code yourself.
